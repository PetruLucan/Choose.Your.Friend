This is an app wich usses 2 APIs to search for dogs breed names and images.<br>
## Implementation<br>
Overall I made a function wich sends a request to an API for breed names, wich name is used after that to send another request, to a defferent API in order to get the image.
Used Math.random to pick a random picture from APIs response.<br>
